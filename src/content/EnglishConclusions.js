        <P>
        Those of us who make software are used to people around the world posting their resolutions and explanations for whoever is looking to read them. For that line I wrote, and I left as clear as I could on this site my own mistakes, the corresponding self-criticism and what I consider to be the superlative degree of backwardness that the exercise of the veterinary professions has. Therefore, consider:

            <li>
            When a dog begins to overeat, drink and urinate more, he turns his appetite towards carbohydrates, whether sweet or salty, and with much more reason if a hard belly appears near the ribs, far from the genitals, there is loss of muscle and high blood levels of ALT-GPT, AST-GOT, triglycerides, cortisol and sodium, it is time to do a urine test of the cortisol/creatinine ratio and to look at the adrenal glands and the liver with ultrasound and the lungs with radiography.
            </li>
        </P>

            Cushing's can be due to a tumor in these glands or a tumor in the pituitary, a gland that is in the center of the skull and gives orders to the adrenal glands. This is always inoperable.
            </li>
        </P>

        <P style={toggleULStyles}>
            <li>
            Trilostane and mitotane serve to reduce corticosteroid release in both types of Cushing's.
            </li>
        </P>

        <P style={toggleULStyles}>
            <li>
            If the tumor is below, on the kidneys, it must be removed as soon as possible and the healthy gland rehabilitated, unless it has already invaded the inferior vena cava. On the possibility of attacking with mitotane or radiation therapy to free the vein and then remove it, consider the possibilities.
            </li>
        </P>

        <P style={toggleULStyles}>
            <li>
            To avoid death, these 3 things must be avoided: growth of the primary, advancement of the primary over the inferior vena cava if it is suprarenal, and metastasis.
            </li>
        </P>

        <P style={toggleULStyles}>
            <li>
            All 3 goals are achieved with a strong defense system, including avoiding carbohydrates, antibiotics, and stress, and keeping cortisol levels low. It can be good to alkalize the body with doses of bicarbonate of soda, potassium and magnesium and strengthen the immune system with vitamin D3.
            </li>
        </P>

        <P style={toggleULStyles}>
            <li>
            It is monitored every 2 months by urine, blood, ultrasound and chest x-ray. If cortisol in urine is high, increase the drug immediately because it lowers the defenses and facilitates metastasis. Pay special attention to parameters that could indicate liver disease. Keep in mind that although cortisol concentrations are fine when sampled on normal days, they may spike on special days or in special situations to harmful levels.
            </li>
        </P>

        <P style={toggleULStyles}>
            <li>
            In case of metastasis, it should first be determined if it is adrenal metastasis or if there is another type of cancer in the body that took advantage of the immune weakness caused by high cortisol.
            </li>
        </P>

        <P style={toggleULStyles}>
            <li>
            If the adrenal type is confirmed, it can be attacked immediately with mitotane. If there are significant metastases, a dose of trilostane must be maintained while advancing. Have hydrocortisone and dexamethasone injections on hand to use if a crisis comes.
            </li>
        </P>

        <P style={toggleULStyles}>
            <li>
            The new life consists of introducing synthetic corticosteroids every 12 hours in the minimum dose needed for a normal day. Learn the doses and times of each of the drugs. Have injectables ready for emergencies. You'll need a glucocorticoid boost whenever you're scared or stressed or anxious or get hit or develop an infection and so on.
            </li>
        </P>

        <P style={toggleULStyles}>
            <li>
            Move within a small area with professionals who know the case. Hide the animal from professionals who do not know what it is about and believe they are heroes for euthanizing without consideration.
            </li>
        </P>

        <P style={toggleULStyles}>
            <li>
            Have an injectable sedative ready in case of collapse and thus be able to take him half asleep to the emergency room.
            </li>
        </P>

        <P style={toggleULStyles}>
            <li>
            The other option, of course, is to consider that a dog shouldn't live without adrenal cortices; give him more trilostane, strengthen the defenses and see if he can reverse the picture without mitotane. I don't know what a conventional chemotherapy could promise; my experience with a veterinary oncologist was the one I recounted.
            </li>
