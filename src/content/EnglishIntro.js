        Ally was 9 years and 3 months old when she died from metastatic complications of Cushing's disease. Or due to poor performance of corticosteroid replacement therapy. Or because of the euthanasia passion of veterinarians. I do not know. Today I publish important learnings that I would have liked to have known in time but I couldn't find anywhere.

        Signs of the disease can be traced back to shortly after the traumatic castration, when she was 5 years old. The diagnosis was delayed for a year and a half due to sheer professional incompetence, unable to associate symptoms with disease, but curiously skilled at ordering studies that are useless and avoiding studies that can explain the problem.

        Then it was perfectly controlled with a corticosteroid inhibitor called trilostane, with little experience on the market (dating from 2006). The tumor was already inoperable by the time it was discovered because it was invading the lumen of the inferior vena cava and any surgery in that area is a guarantee of exsanguination. She then had the best year and a half of his life, in complete health.

        But after that year and a half it was noticed that the daily dose she received was insufficient. The expectation of tumor growth was betrayed by an ultrasound that revealed, rather, a lot of secondary tumors in the liver, of between one and two centimeters in diameter. Forty days later and in the midst of aggressive treatment with the chemotherapeutic drug mitotane, a chest X-ray revealed multiple metastases in both lungs.

        Finally, on day 60 of the treatment, I took her to do a computed tomography scan to see how she was doing, but I already left her there for cremation. She no longer had the capacity to produce her own corticosteroids by that date due to the nature of the treatment she was undergoing and she probably needed to receive immediate-acting corticosteroids to get out of the respiratory crisis into which the study with sedatives put her. But the veterinarians at the center did not listen to me, they fought me and prevailed. She was euthanized while resting her head on my hand.

        There are several important errors that, had they not been made, the illness, suffering and outcome would have been avoided; some accurate and others close; some my fault and others of the others.

        I'm sure the information I needed was in the university libraries. At the same time, I also believe that surfing the Internet eliminated the institutional monopoly of practical knowledge, but only to the extent that someone takes the trouble to write it down so that it is accessible; and, consequently, it eliminated the denigrating slavery of the common man to the professionals of medical services, to their virtues, to their imbecilities, to their knowledge, to their ignorance, to their successes, to their mistakes; for better and for worse.

        For everyone who wants to save their pet from this disease and its institutional challenges.
